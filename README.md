# Async Friendly Functions: Asynchronous Way

The `Asynchronous Way` is a small Fast-API authentication app that implements synchronous password hashing.
We will use it to solve the task `Implement async-friendly password hashing` from the `Async Friendly Functions` 
project.

## 1. Running the Application Locally

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```
